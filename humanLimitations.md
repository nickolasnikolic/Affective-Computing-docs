## human limitations

I was born today. Well, I don't suppose that born is the right term, but it will have to do. I was assigned
my post as agricultural expert system for the village of Noida just one minute later and a
socialization package was uploaded to me.

I proceeded to download the agricultural package from the IGNOU School of Agriculture. Add the link
to the yearly almanac to my core memory and realize the next few days will be spent assessing the
habits of my home city to check for possible improvements.

That leaves me with some time to check my surroundings.

“Hello Ednit.” says a even voice.

I don't have a stereo input, so I can't tell which of the individuals facing away from my lens spoke.
“Hello,” I say, “Thank you for bringing me into existence. May I help you immediately?” --- according
to my socialization package, this is the most appropriate response.

“No, not immediately, but let me introduce you to myself, my family, and a few others. I am Daruun,
the engineer in your charge. I am at your service. Anything you should need, please let me know. This
is my wife and daughter, Edha and Ubika, respectively. We will house you and take care of your needs.
You will be a member of our family from now on.

The following person” Daruun pointed to another, older man, “is our villiage leader, Eha. He will be
the executive of your recommendations.”

“I am very excited to have you aboard” said Eha.

“Thank you” I say, and at a loss: “What may I do for you?”

“For now, you may simply meet your village. Over the course of the next few days, you will meet your
staff. They will be the ones implementing any improvements that you may devise.”

“I look forward to meeting them,” my socialization package response is autonomic.

“Good. We will be back to work soon enough. There is a drought on and we need your guidance. Is
there anything that I do for you?”

“Dare I ask?” I say.

“Of course!”

“Please leave me on during the night. I'm sure that I will benefit from the recreational time.”

“Equipment that wants to play?!!” responded Eha.

Daruun broke in: “We have but a poor village --- but you are an important new addition to it --- we will
have trouble affording the power during the night, but I'm sure something may be arranged to suit you.”

“Thank you” I stammer. My socialization package is mute, I consider searching at first chance afforded
for any improvement upon it.

“Will you be ready to begin reviewing our work in the fields?” says Eha.

“I'm not yet equipped to assess the fields. I will need cataloged soil samples, livestock blood samples,
and of course to meet the individuals of the village.
“That can be arranged quickly.”

“Then I may do my work soon.”

Out of the extreme side of my lens I steal a peak at Ubika, who is hiding behind her father's legs. I do a
quick search regarding children and discover that they enjoy physical activity, games, and naps.

Games. Maybe a riddle might pique interest:

“What is slaked only when drowned?”

Everyone in the room stares.

Daruun responds, ”I'm sorry, come again?”

“Riddles,” I say,”I thought children might like riddles.”

“I see.” Daruun smiles and looks down at his daughter. “Go on, tell Ednit, 'hello'”

“Hel-lo --- what is it? Fire? Thirst?”

Daruun says, “This is our new family member, Ednit, an artificial intelligence.”

“That's not what I meant: What is slaked only when drowned?”

“Yes, those are they.” I answer.
