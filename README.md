“I am very excited to have you aboard” said Eha.

“Thank you” I say, and at a loss: “What may I do for you?”

“For now, you may simply meet your village. Over the course of the next few days, you will meet your
staff. They will be the ones implementing any improvements that you may devise.”

“I look forward to meeting them,” my socialization package response is autonomic.

“Good. We will be back to work soon enough. There is a drought on and we need your guidance. Is
there anything that I do for you?”

“Dare I ask?” I say.

“Of course!”

“Please leave me on during the night. I'm sure that I will benefit from the recreational time.”

“Equipment that wants to play?!!” responded Eha.

Daruun broke in: “We have but a poor village --- but you are an important new addition to it --- we will
have trouble affording the power during the night, but I'm sure something may be arranged to suit you.”

“Thank you” I stammer. My socialization package is mute, I consider searching at first chance afforded
for any improvement upon it.

“Will you be ready to begin reviewing our work in the fields?” says Eha.

“I'm not yet equipped to assess the fields. I will need cataloged soil samples, livestock blood samples,
and of course to meet the individuals of the village.
“That can be arranged quickly.”

“Then I may do my work soon.”

Out of the extreme side of my lens I steal a peak at Ubika, who is hiding behind her father's legs. I do a
quick search regarding children and discover that they enjoy physical activity, games, and naps.

Games. Maybe a riddle might pique interest:

“What is slaked only when drowned?”

Everyone in the room stares.

Daruun responds, ”I'm sorry, come again?”

“Riddles,” I say,”I thought children might like riddles.”

“I see.” Daruun smiles and looks down at his daughter. “Go on, tell Ednit 'hello'”
“Hel-lo --- what is it? Fire?”

Daruun says, “This is our new family member, Ednit, and artificial intelligence.”

“That's not what I meant: What is slaked only when drowned?”

“Yes, that is it.” I answer.
